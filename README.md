# Leetcode
Here I will be putting coding problems I have done, primarily from leetcode.

## File structure
The solved problems will go in the solved_problems directory, with naming convention as follows:
    - The letter q followed by the question number for the problem from leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/
    - This will be followed by the name of the problem from the same source.
For example, "q121_best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock.py".

Corresponding testing for each script will go into the .tests/ folder, where each test will follow the the simple naming convention of "test_" followed by the corresponding question number.
For example, "test_q121.py"

## Usage
I will be adding instructions for using this repo with Conda, Venv and Docker once they are implemented. Currently only implemented Conda environment, instrctions to come.

## Installation

## Testing
Once package has been downloaded, one can use the:
```bash
pytest
```
command in cli to run the tests in ./tests
