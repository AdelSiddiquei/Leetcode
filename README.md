# Leetcode
Here I will be putting coding problems I have done, primarily from leetcode.

## File structure
The solved problems will go in the solved_problems directory, with naming convention as follows:
    - The letter q followed by the question number for the problem from leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/
    - This will be followed by the name of the problem from the same source.
For example, "q121_best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock.py".

Corresponding testing for each script will go into the .tests/ folder, where each test will follow the the simple naming convention of "test_" followed by the corresponding question number.
For example, "test_q121.py"

## Usage
I will be adding instructions for using this repo with Conda, Venv and Docker once they are implemented. Currently only implemented Conda environment, instrctions to come.
The first step is to clone this repo, and then use the appropriate method to install the package. Instructions using Conda, Venv and Docker are below:

### Conda

### Docker
The Dockerfile has been set up such that a user is expected to enter a container interactively and explore my solutions/tests in terminal. 

### Venv

## Installation

## Testing
Once package has been downloaded, one can use the:
```bash
pytest
```
command in cli to run the tests in ./tests
